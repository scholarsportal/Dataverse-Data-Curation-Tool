#+title: Data Curation Tool

* Run Sequence
Entry Point: ```interface.component.ts```
- The interface component uses the ```getBaseUrl()``` to get the baseURL
- The interface component uses the ```getParameterByName(name)``` to get the siteURL, _id, metaId, and dvLocale
- The dvLocale is used to set the language
- If there is not siteURL or _id, the uri created uses a file in the assets folder
- if there is a siteURL, there are more checks to create the uri
- The Uri created is passed on ```getDDI()```

* Potential Problems
- Converting the XML to JSON on the client
